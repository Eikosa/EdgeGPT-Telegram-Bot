        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in EdgeGPT-Telegram-Bot!**

          * First, be sure you are running the [latest version of the EdgeGPT-Telegram-Bot](https://github.com/scmanjarrez/EdgeGPT-Telegram-Bot/releases).
          * You will also need to run the bot with the argument `--debug`
            * `python src/edge.py --debug`
            * `docker run ... --debug`
          * Finally, when submitting a bug report, you **must** include the traceback. This allows the developers to examine and debug the error.

        Thank you for your help!
